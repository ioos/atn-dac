How to Submit Deployment Metadata
=================================

Depending on your project funding and other factors, you may need to submit pre-deployment metadata and post-deployment metadata for your project. To do this, use the ``ATN Tag Deployment Metadata Template`` as described in the steps below.

.. note::

	You will need a `Research Workspace <https://researchworkspace.com/>`_ account to submit metadata. If you haven't created one yet, please see the `Creating & Accessing an Account <https://researchworkspace.com/help/CreatingAccountTutorial.html>`_ tutorial.

Pre-Deployment Metadata
-----------------------

#. Log in to your Research Workspace account.
#. Navigate to your project.
#. Click on the ``Metadata template`` folder in the folder tree on the left.
#. Download either the XLSX or CSV version of the ``ATN Tag Deployment Metadata Template`` file (whichever format your prefer to work with; both files are the same).
#. Fill in the first 5 columns (Columns A-F, which have a green background in the XLSX file) with information for each tag (1 row per tag).
#. Save the file somewhere easy to find on your computer.
#. Upload the completed file to the ``Data`` folder of your project in the Research Workspace.

Post-Deployment Metadata
------------------------

#. Download the pre-deployment metadata file you uploaded in the steps above.
#. Fill in the remaining columns (F-P, shaded blue in the XLSX file) with deployment information (1 row per tag).
#. Save the file somewhere easy to find on your computer.
#. Upload the completed file to the ``Data`` folder of your project in the Research Workspace.
